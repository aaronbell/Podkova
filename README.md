# Podkova fonts

Open-source font by Ilya Yudin for Cyreal

Podkova is a monoline slab serif with diagonal terminals. Wide proportions and clean features aid to legibility at small sizes. Its unusual letterforms provide enough character to be used at display sizes. Podkova is the Russian word for Horseshoe. Try it and see if the lucky charm works for you!

Podkova is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

#### Supported glyphs sets:

* Core Latin 
* GF Cyrillic Plus
