Podkova is a monoline slab serif with diagonal terminals. 
Wide proportions and clean features aid to legibility at small sizes. 
Its unusual letterforms provide enough character to be used at display sizes. 
Podkova is the Russian word for Horseshoe. 
Try it and see if the lucky charm works for you!

Designed by Ilya Yudin.

Podkova is a Unicode typeface family that supports
